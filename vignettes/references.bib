	abstract = {Outlines of wings from 127 species of North American mosquitoes were digitized. Comparisons were made among several different methods of reducing the information in the resulting coordinates to a series of descriptors that could be used in multivariate analysis. Methods included Fourier analysis of both radii and tangent angle change functions. In addition, the relatively new method of elliptic Fourier analysis was tried. Cluster and ordination analyses based on the various sets of descriptors summarized well the pattern of similarities and differences in wing shapes, but clusters of similar wings do not agree well with traditional taxonomic groupings. The use of elliptic Fourier descriptors appears to be especially promising for future work.},

	abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to explore possible cultural continuities and discontinuities at the Neolithic transition in Eastern Iberia. To address this issue, we introduce a twofold methodology, consisting of Geometric Morphometrics and the use of the self-developed Geomeasure system, to examine evolutionary patterns in geometric microliths. These are a specific type of arrowhead shared by both the last hunter-gatherers and the first farmers from two reference sites in the region: Cueva de la Cocina and Cova de l’Or (Eastern Iberia). Although advances in research have contributed to a better comprehension of this process, there are still unanswered questions, especially when the study is approached from a regional perspective. Such is the case for the Neolithisation of the Eastern Iberian Peninsula, and the way in which the previous Mesolithic population interacted—if they interacted at all—with the first farmers. In this case, some sites present archaeological contexts that have been catalogued as acculturation contexts. This has traditionally been the case for phase C of Cueva de la Cocina (Spain), although recent research points to the possibility that the content of this specific deposit is the result of post-depositional processes. Here we try first to understand the cultural evolutionary patterns and relations between the different geometric microlith technocomplexes and, second, to address the specific problem of the interpretation of taphonomic disturbances in the archaeological record. We use the Cueva de l’Or and the Cueva de la Cocina for comparison, and our conclusions raise serious doubts about the existence of an acculturation phase at the latter.},

	abstract = {This work presents the analysis of the geometric microliths of Cueva de la Cocina (València, Spain). It does so considering the hypothesis that, given the size of the cave's assemblage and its distinctive cultural markers, it could have acted as an aggregation site for the Late Mesolithic in the Mediterranean Iberia. The work presented here uses the cultural similarity of the geometric microliths of different sites to test this hypothesis, relying on several methodological techniques such as tactical simulation and geometric morphometrics, while offering proposals for the correction of data imbalance in archaeological data. As a conclusion, our data points to the fact that, for the last phase of the Late Mesolithic (phase B in the regional sequence) the site could have indeed acted as an aggregation site, but we require caution on the results of our analysis fundamentally on two grounds: (1) whether the cultural variation of the geometric microliths offers enough resolution for microscale analysis and (2) the necessity to combine this proxy with other types of archaeological artefacts which could give (or rest) strength to our hypothesis.},

Advantages of the procedure are that it does not require integration or the use of fast Fourier transform techniques, and that bounds on the accuracy of the image contour reconstruction are easy to specify. Elliptic properties of the Fourier coefficients are shown and used for a convenient and intuitively pleasing procedure of normalizing a Fourier contour representation. Extension of the contour representation to arbitrary objects at arbitrary aspect angle is discussed. The procedures have direct application to a variety of pattern recognition problems that involve analysis of well-defined image contours.},

	shorttitle = {Spatial {Data} {Science}},
	abstract = {Spatial Data Science introduces fundamental aspects of spatial data that every data scientist should know before they start working with spatial data. These aspects include how geometries are represented, coordinate reference systems (projections, datums), the fact that the Earth is round and its consequences for analysis, and how attributes of geometries can relate to geometries. In the second part of the book, these concepts are illustrated with data science examples using the R language. In the third part, statistical modelling approaches are demonstrated using real world data examples. After reading this book, the reader will be well equipped to avoid a number of major spatial data analysis errors.

The book gives a detailed explanation of the core spatial software packages for R: sf for simple feature access, and stars for raster and vector data cubes – array data with spatial and temporal dimensions. It also shows how geometrical operations change when going from a flat space to the surface of a sphere, which is what sf and stars use when coordinates are not projected (degrees longitude/latitude). Separate chapters detail a variety of plotting approaches for spatial maps using R, and different ways of handling very large vector or raster (imagery) datasets, locally, in databases, or in the cloud. The data used and all code examples are freely available online from https://r-spatial.org/book/. The solutions to the exercises can be found here: https://edzer.github.io/sdsr\_exercises/.},
